					Incompleteness Theorems
				</a>
	   			<dd>Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem says that if you have a consistent logical system (i.e., a set of axioms with no contradictions) in which you can do a certain amount of arithmetic, then there are statements in that system which are unprovable using just that system’s axioms. Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem gives a specific example of such an unprovable statement.
				    I wrote a paper thingy on it with my dear friend and soulmate Shri Shri Satbhav Voleti.
