	 <p>Iâ€™m a graduate student at IISER Kolkata majoring in mathematics with a minor in physics.
         I also have a deep-rooted interest in philosophy and literature. </p> 
  
        <p>On the math/physics side, my fields of interest are algebraic topology and mathematical physics. Philosophically, I have been engaging seriously with existential 
	 phenomenology for the last couple of years.</p>
