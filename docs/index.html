	 <p>Iâ€™m an incoming doctoral student at the University of Regina's Department of Mathematics & Statistics.
         I also have a deep-rooted passion for philosophy and writing. </p> 
  
        <p> My research interests lie in mathematical physics (you can find my masters' thesis  
		<a href="https://adityadwarkesh.github.io/CVs/Thesis%20report.pdf" style="color: #15727D">  here</a>).
		Philosophically, I have been engaging seriously with existential 
	 	phenomenology for the last couple of years.</p> 
  
        <p> <a href="https://adityadwarkesh.github.io/CVs/CV.pdf" style="color: #15727D">
			Here </a> is a complete CV. I cannot help but add that I have come to find the modern concept of a CV, due to the transformation of 
				an individual into a product which it signifies, profoundly disturbing and somewhat upsetting.
